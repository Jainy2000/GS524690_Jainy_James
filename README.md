## What Went Well

### Key Achievements
1. **Efficient State Management**: Used React state and hooks effectively to manage dynamic data rendering.
2. **API Integration**: Successfully integrated and fetched data from the API with error handling by implementing the capability to import the online sample data from Google Sheets to prepopulate the application screens.
3. **Responsive UI Design**: Ensured the UI is adaptive and user-friendly across different screen sizes.
4. **Authentication**: The application includes authentication & authorization. The login credentails are:
```sh
username: admin
password: password123
```

I chose these elements because they showcase my ability to write clean, maintainable code while ensuring performance and usability.

## Improvements with 4 More Hours

1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize re-renders by implementing memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error messages and introduce retry logic for failed API requests.
3. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Ensure proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.
4. **More Test Coverage**: Expand unit tests to cover edge cases and integration scenarios.
5. **Minimizing API Calls**: Implement Redux or Context API to store and manage fetched data efficiently, reducing redundant API calls.
6. **Better Jest Test Cases**: Improve test coverage with additional Jest cases for different scenarios.

These improvements would enhance performance, resilience, and user experience.

## Feedback on the Challenge (Optional)
- Clarifying expected UI behaviors for edge cases (e.g., empty states, API failures) would ensure consistency in implementation.
- Overall, the challenge was well-structured and relevant to frontend development tasks.
